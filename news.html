                    Final stage of assembly is finished as today we start to fire up our dryer. Still a little tinkering 
                    is on its way until we fully configure the equipment and can be confident that we have full control 
                    over the moisture level. As in our experience various final product manufacturers have different 
                    needs regarding the moisture. With this step we are swiftly moving towards normal production times 
                    and volumes. We hope to be working full shifts by the end of the month.

                    possible. Especially we have set our minds to reduce thickness tolerance to 0.02mm. Let's see if 
                    we can achieve our goals! In the meantime we will appreciate the smell of the first freshly peeled

                    the dryer. It took some serious skill from the truck crane driver. But Jēkabpils has all the best 
                    professionals, so we managed with excellence. In the meantime we are also renovating our office and 
                    already discussing the best place for a coffee machine. The to-do list never runs out and the factory 
                    is slowly taking shape.

                    working hard to install the equipment in time for the new production season. Yesterday we swept the

                    If you look closely, you can see that it most directly reflects our main production process: a blade 
                    peels the log, and a veneer sheet detaches. At a time when AI and “Scandinavian minimalism” have taken 
                    over the public space, we wanted to return to a more traditional solution — an illustration rather than 
                    a symbol.

                    friendship from old work relations opened a completely new option in the same city even more suitable 
                    for our needs. Today we are happy to say that we have officially signed the contract and can call
