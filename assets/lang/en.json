During the production process, we trace each product pallet individually, which means we can assign the necessary FSC¬Æ label for each order. At the same time, we are trying to get acquainted with the EUDR system and the creation of DDS. We hope that together we will be able to ensure 100% tracking in the wood industry and prevent any illegal efforts that harm market prices. To a prosperous future!üçæ"
