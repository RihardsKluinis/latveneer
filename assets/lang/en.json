      "text": "The snow has not pampered us with its beauty this year. We hear that this has not been a white winter for our customers either. As a result, we decided that this year's Christmas greeting should be a little more special. That is why we have created a handmade design using the intaglio printing technique. To have more colour and therefore magic, two clichés were carved and printed on top of each other with great precision work. We hope to add a little bit of holiday cheer to this winter of global warming consequences."

During the production process, we trace each product pallet individually, which means we can assign the necessary FSC® label for each order. At the same time, we are trying to get acquainted with the EUDR system and the creation of DDS. We hope that together we will be able to ensure 100% tracking in the wood industry and prevent any illegal efforts that harm market prices. To a prosperous future!🍾"

Once again, it proves that human relationships are the most important thing in business. Now we can take the “bull by the horns”, plan the layout, order equipment, and everything else before moving in. Wish us luck!"
